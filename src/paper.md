# Summary

The control of quantum systems lies at the heart of quantum computation and 
is studied via the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA), i.e. the Lie algebra that is generated 
by terms in the system's Hamiltonian. Paulie is an open source package for the Lie algebraic 
study of closed quantum systems. A complete classification of the DLA for systems that are
generated by products of Pauli matrices has been derived in [@Aguilar:2024].
Here, we present an efficient algorithm for this classification that also identifies linear dependencies 
inside the generator set. Moreover, with our tools we provide for a given algebra the optimal generator sets 
inspired by [@Smith:2025]. Through Hamiltonian encodings and efficient computations of Lie closures, 
we give a numerical study of the DLA for generator sets consisting of linear combinations of Paulistrings.
Beyond the characterization of long-term dynamics, we feature measures of quantum chaos, and complexity derived
in [@West:2025] which we relate to the long-term dynamics.

# Statement of need

`paulie` is a Python package to study the dynamics of 1D closed quantum systems. 
Python enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. 
`paulie` was designed to be used by both quantum computing researchers and by
students in courses on quantum information.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
