# Summary

The control of quantum systems lies at the heart of quantum computation and is studied via the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA), i.e. the Lie algebra that is generated by terms in the system's Hamiltonian. 
Tensor products of Pauli matrices (Pauli strings) form a basis of Hermitian operators and as such appear as generators in trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. Moreover they naturally arise as effective control Hamiltonians in trapped-ion systems and also occur in measurement-based quantum computation.
While a conceptually complete classification of systems that are generated by Pauli strings is known, this classification was not packaged as an explicit, scalable procedure, and therefore remained difficult to deploy in concrete design tasks.
Here, we present an efficient algorithm for this classification that directly allows to study the controllability of Pauli string generated systems. We showcase the utility of our framework by numerically providing the optimal universal generator sets as well as equivalent generating sets for a specific algebra. 
The package also includes further utilities for circuit compilation tasks as well as for studying short-term dynamics. 

# Statement of need

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
